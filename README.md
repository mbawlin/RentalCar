Bobcar Rent-a-Car is a self-service program that provides users the final cost of their rental. 

The program has three classes, Economy, Compact, and Standard. The program asks the user which type of car they want to rent, how many days they went to rent it, and asks whether or not they are a club member. Being a club member opens up another option, the Platinum Executive Package, which is an additional 20% cost of the base price.  Next, the program calculates the cost of the rental, and applies a discount if they are a club member and if they wanted the Platinum Executive Package.

The total amount estimated is printed out.
